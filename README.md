## Introduction

![1682351786312](image/README/1682351786312.png)This is a website I have created for my portfolio where I can add all the information about myself, my professional background, academic background and achievements. It stemed from a desire to improve my skills from what I have learnt in class and do more practice to increase my proficiency.

## Overview

From determining the doctype to creating a link back to the main page it was an interesting process. The first page has the intoduction and the links to the about page as well as a linkage relationship for stylesheets. Here I have used the properties to change and beautify the page using colors and background differenciation. 

The second page has a linkage relationship to the styles sheet a well as links to other sites with more information on my work and achievements. I have also included information about myself and what I am good at. I am expecting to do better as I learn more

## Next Steps

I aim make this body better as I add more and more into the document while I learn more and get more insights. Stay tuned.
