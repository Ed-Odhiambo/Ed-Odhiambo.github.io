            <br>
            I am currently studying data science at Moringa School Kenya, and have interacted with creating datasets, analysing them, visualizing them and finally interpreting them. I graduated with 2<sup>nd</sup> class honors at <a href="https://economics.ku.ac.ke/" class="first">Kenyatta University.</a> Here I learnt Macroeconomic theory and Microeconomics, global trade, financial markets and institutions and the general outlook of markets.

            I am also a holder of a financial investment certificate (CIFA 1) from KASNEB having completed the module. I finished my highschool with a mean grade of A-, similarly the case for my primary.
